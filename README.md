# How to build ISO

You need to use an installed EndeavourOS system or any archbased system with EndeavourOS [repository](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/mirrors) enabled.

As the installer packages and needed dependencies will get installed from EndeavourOS repository.

General information: 

https://endeavouros-team.github.io/EndeavourOS-Development/

Read the changelog before starting to learn about latest changes:

https://github.com/endeavouros-team/EndeavourOS-ISO/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

### Install build dependencies

```
sudo pacman -S archiso git squashfs-tools --needed
```
It is recommended to reboot after these changes.

### Build

##### 1. Prepare

If you want the last release state to rebuild the ISO, you need to use a specifically tagged tarball from here:
https://github.com/endeavouros-team/EndeavourOS-ISO/tags

If not, it will default to using the latest "unstable" development state.

example using latest **stable** release (23.11.1.2 Galileo KDE Release) 

**Warning:** do **not** use the zip tarball, in case this causes issues with symlinks.

```
wget https://github.com/endeavouros-team/EndeavourOS-ISO/archive/refs/tags/23.11.1.2.tar.gz
tar -xvf 23.11.1.2.tar.gz
cd "EndeavourOS-ISO-23.11.1.2"
./prepare.sh
```
### Or use latest **unstable** development branch using by cloning this repo using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/endeavouros-team/EndeavourOS-ISO.git
cd EndeavourOS-ISO
./prepare.sh
```
### In case you want to build pre Galileo Releases:

If  that you can use older tags like:
```
wget https://github.com/endeavouros-team/EndeavourOS-ISO/archive/refs/tags/22.12.2.tar.gz
tar -xvf 22.12.2.tar.gz
cd "EndeavourOS-ISO-22.12.2"
./prepare.sh
```
But caused by the change to KDE these iso will use XFCE4 LiveSession and you will need to build calamares manually to get old style theming that is setup for the XFCE4 LiveSession:

using this PKGBUILD: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/PKGBUILDS/18e3f580abb68486091492168956619bb0f32abe/calamares/PKGBUILD

And put the resulting package into ISO structure to get installed with the ISO build procedure:

`airootfs/root/packages/`

To get this working you need to remove `calamares` from `packages.x86_64` before starting ISO build.

##### 2. Build

~~~
sudo ./mkarchiso -v "."
~~~

**or with log:**

~~~
sudo ./mkarchiso -v "." 2>&1 | tee "eosiso_$(date -u +'%Y.%m.%d-%H:%M').log"
~~~

##### 3. The .iso file appears in the `out` directory...


## Advanced

To install locally built packages on ISO, put the packages inside the following directory:

~~~
airootfs/root/packages
~~~

Packages will be installed and the directory will be cleaned up after that.
